About
=====

Hi!  My name is Jessica and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Applied Science in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Antennas, Microwaves, and Wave Optics at the Unversity of Waterloo.  I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Physics in 2022 from the University of Waterloo.  On the side, I enjoy learning language and culture and have an East Asian Studies Diploma and Japanese Language Certificate from Renison University College.


## Research Interests

My research interests include Electromagnetics and Radar Systems.  I am working on multiphysics simulations for electromagnetic and thermal analysis for radar systems as part of my Masters thesis.<br />
Supervisors:  Prof. George Shaker (Wireless Sensors and Devices Lab), Prof. Lan Wei (Waterloo Emerging Integrated Systems Group)

In my senior undergraduate research project, I studied the dielectric characterization and microwave sensing of fat concentration in milk under the supervision of Prof. George Shaker and Prof. Stefan Idziak.
