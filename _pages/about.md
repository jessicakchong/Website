About
=====

Hi!  My name is Jessica and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Applied Science in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Antennas, Microwaves, and Wave Optics at the Unversity of Waterloo.  I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Physics in 2022 from the University of Waterloo.  On the side, I enjoy learning language and culture and have an East Asian Studies Diploma and Japanese Language Certificate from Renison University College.
