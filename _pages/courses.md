A list of courses that I've taken at the University of Waterloo from most recent to oldest.  Course descriptions taken from the corresponding academic calendar for that year.

# Graduate Courses

## Winter 2023 (Ongoing)
##### ECE 730 - Topic: Biosensing: Fundamentals & Applications
The objective of the course is to impart knowledge needed to evaluate a proposed biosensing technology.  In this course, an introduction to the field of biosensors and an in-depth and quantitative view of device design and performance analysis will be given.  Biosensors are defined as self-contained integrated devices capable of providing analytical information, using a biological recognition element in conjunction with a secondary transduction element. Students will be introduced to different biosensing techniques, such as electrical biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and optical biosensors with an emphasis on biomedical and environmental applications. The general principles of sampling and analysis, statistical presentation, and manipulation of data will be also presented. Students will also learn about the continuous and real-time biosensors, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices.  Taught by Mahla Poudineh.

#### ECE 770 - Topic: Radio and Wireless Systems
Modern transmitter and receiver architectures, Noise and linearity in radio and wireless systems, Design considerations of RF/microwave subsystems, radio and wireless system designs, CAD tools for radio and wireless systems, Antennas, Radio wave propagation models, Indoor radio, Satellite communication, Personal communication systems (PCSs).  Taught by Slim Boumaiza.

## Fall 2022
##### ECE 671 - Microwave and RF Engineering
Fundamentals of microwave and RF circuit analysis, design and measurements; Generalized transmission line analysis; S-parameters; Coupler and filter design; Diode-detectors, and mixers; Low-noise and power amplifiers, oscillators; Computer aided design of RF circuits.  Taught by Slim Boumaiza.

##### ECE 675 - Radiation & Propagation of Electromagnetic Fields
Mathematics of time varying electromagnetic fields, linear antennas self and mutual impedance, aperture antenna, wave diffraction theory, geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD).  Taught by Omar Ramahi.
