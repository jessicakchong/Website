# Graduate Course Projects
##  Rapid Detection of Covid-19 Using Transistor-based Biosensors
***ECE 730 (Biosensing:  Fundamentals and Applications) Winter 2023 Final Project*** <br />

# PHYS 437 Projects
## [Effect of Milk Fat Content on Dielectric Properties at 200 MHz - 20 GHz](https://github.com/jessicakchong/PHYS437Project/blob/main/PHYS%20437B%20Report%20(Jessica%20Chong).pdf)
***PHYS 437B Winter 2022 Research Project Course Continued*** <br />
Supervised by: Prof. George Shaker, Prof. Stefan Idziak <br />
(Abstract) To understand the effect of milk fat content on dielectric properties to develop a butterfat detector for real-time monitoring, 5-35% creams are tested on the DAK-TL, an open-ended coaxial probe, connected to a vector network analyzer over the frequency range 200 MHz to 20 GHz. The results showed that the dielectric constants and losses decreased linearly with an increase in milk fat content and that the other constituents of milk also affect the dielectric properties of cream. The results indicated that the DAK-TL is not great for studying the effect of temperature and volumetric resonances arose in the data, suggesting a larger volume and different instrument should be used for more accurate measurements. Two regression models were developed to determine the amount of fat content of a given sample based on the dielectric constant and dielectric loss with promising results. If the dielectric properties are differentiable, then the fat content can be predicted, and a butterfat detector may be possible to be implemented at farms and fluid dairy manufacturing facilities.

## [Dielectric Properties of Salt and Sugar Solutions at 200 MHz - 10 GHz](https://github.com/jessicakchong/PHYS437Project/blob/main/PHYS%20437A%20Report%20(Jessica%20Chong).pdf)
***PHYS 437A Fall 2021 Research Project Course*** <br />
Supervised by: Prof. George Shaker, Prof. Stefan Idziak <br />
(Abstract)  With recent developments in technology, the low-cost and non-invasive monitoring of food quality has been a popular subject of study.  The dielectric properties of various concentrations of salt and sugar dissolved in distilled water are measured using an open-ended coaxial probe technique over the frequency range 200 MHz to 10 GHz.  The conducted literature survey indicates a decrease in the value of the dielectric constant and an increase of the dielectric loss with an increase in concentration over this frequency range.  Since the dielectric properties vary, the survey indicates that it is possible to develop a radar that can accurately detect these concentrations and the slight variances in a food product.  Inconsistent results have been achieved using the DAK-TL 3.5 probe that show drastically opposite trends of theoretical values.

# Course Projects
## Fundamentals of Stokes Flows and their Applications
***AMATH 361 Winter 2022 Final Project*** <br />
Consider the fast-growing field of microfluidics, where there is a wide range of promising potential applications such as food quality and safety. With its small form factor and sensitivity, it is possible to implement a microfluidic chip for the in-line real-time monitoring and detection of pathogens during transport and through-out the pasteurization process of foods as well as finished products. It is also possible to develop it as a portable biosensor. Oftentimes the conventional colony counting method is used for detection of harmful microorganisms and it takes several days to cultivate them. Thus, there is a need for a more rapid method of detection. In order to understand how to implement such a device, it is important to understand how microorganisms swim and how fluid flows at a micro- and nanoscopic level, which can be studied by examining Stokes flow equations.

## Superconductivity and the Meissner Effect
***PHYS 335 Winter 2021 Chapter Summary Project*** <br />
A self-study chapter project in the PHYS 335 (Condensed Matter) using the textbook written by Kittel. For this project, I chose to study Chapter 10 of Kittel on Superconductivity.

## [Hamilton-Jacobi Formalism in Classical Mechanics](https://github.com/jessicakchong/AMATH456Project)
***AMATH 456 Fall 2020 Term Project*** <br />
As part of the AMATH 456 (Calculus of Variations) course, we had to do a group project that involved writing about a self-study topic as an extension to our current course notes.  We wrote about the theory of Hamiltonian dynamics, a derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and solution methods while expanding on the topics we covered in the course.  We applied the Hamilton-Jacobi method to the Simple Harmonic Oscillator and Kepler's Problem, then compared them to their Lagrangian solutions.
