### [Comprehensive MVSG Compact Model for Power GaN Devices (IEEE ISPSD 2023)](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/document/10147658)

(Abstract)  GaN HEMTs are actively explored for power elec-tronics (e.g. power converters) due to its superior material properties. High-quality compact model addressing critical behaviors of power GaN devices is in demand for large-scale industry deployment. This paper presents the MVSG model for power GaN devices, which has versatile field plate and gate current configurations. The paper also highlights the modeling strategies for important behaviors such as thermal effects, trapping effects and p-GaN gate stack. Thermal effects are represented through a flexible thermal sub-circuit accounting for both self-heating and external thermal coupling. A comprehensive charge trapping model included in MVSG is able to describe both gate- and drain-lag. The newest addition, the p-GaN module, is also introduced in order to accurately model both static and dynamic behaviors due to the Schottky or hybrid p-GaN gate stacks, which is widely used in power GaN devices to achieve enhancement mode operations. The paper explained the physics-based power MVSG model implementation together with the underlying physics. Examples of model usage demonstrate the effectiveness of this comprehensive power GaN compact model.

### [Characterization and Sensing of Milk Fat% in the Low GHz Band](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/document/9886211)
***2022 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC-URSI Radio Science Meeting (AP-S/URSI)*** <br/>
Ala Eldin Omer, Jessica Chong, Lisa Chen, George Shaker

(Abstract) This paper studies the dielectric properties of commercially available milk products of varying butterfat 0.1 – 3.25% in the low spectrum 1 – 10 GHz using an open-ended coaxial probe kit. Extracted properties have indicated an appreciably dielectric contrast between tested milks with a negative linear relationship between the dispersive complex permittivity and the fat content. A resonant sensor was developed to operate in one sensitive region to allow for non- invasive milk fat detection by monitoring changes in the resonance profile of the transmission coefficient S21.
