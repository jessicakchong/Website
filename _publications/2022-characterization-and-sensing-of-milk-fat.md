This paper studies the dielectric properties of commercially available milk products of varying butterfat 0.1 – 3.25% in the low spectrum 1 – 10 GHz using an open-ended coaxial probe kit. Extracted properties have indicated an appreciably dielectric contrast between tested milks with a negative linear relationship between the dispersive complex permittivity and the fat content. A resonant sensor was developed to operate in one sensitive region to allow for non- invasive milk fat detection by monitoring changes in the resonance profile of the transmission coefficient S21.
